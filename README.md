## Chaos Levels

| Level | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| 1 | Subtle - occasional informal swap |
| 2 | Light - few typos, grammar mix-ups |
| 3 | Medium - noticeable imperfections |
| 4 | Heavy - obvious human errors |
| 5 | Maximum - chaotic typing |

## Why?

AI detection tools look for "too perfect" text. Real humans:
- Make typos
- Use informal language
- Forget punctuation rules
- Start sentences with "And" or "But"

Mistakelfy adds these natural imperfections while keeping text readable.
